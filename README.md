**Business Case**
This document overviews the project plan for Flyer Capstone project built by Alison Nguyen. Time flies when you are juggling a class schedule, meetings, activities, and self care. As someone who considers themself a busy body, always on the move, it is easy to lose track of time. Flyer is a time management application where individuals can time block their tasks and responsibilities to automate schedules allowing them to focus on their tasks at hand.

Users will be able to set their work schedule for the day, categorizing their tasks, and schedule meeting times with other collaborators. Users will be able to create block events, where they can set a name for the event/task, notes regarding the task, time allotted for tasks, categorize them by priority to non urgent basis. Users can use the Flyer UI to view their tasks, or import events into their preferred calendars. 

There is a niche business case where business owners can set their availability times and users who want to schedule appointments or meetings with said person. Once the event has been created it will alert the business owner and once it has been accepted it will block out time in their schedule and will remind the user prior to the event.
